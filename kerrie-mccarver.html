Her zodiac sign is Capricorn, and she follows Christianity.&nbsp;</p><p>Talking about her childhood, she could not enjoy her childish life to the fullest because her family was destitute, and it was difficult for them to run their livelihood.&nbsp;</p><h2>Know About McCarver's Love Journey&nbsp;</h2><p>As mentioned above, Kerrie McCarver became prominent after marrying former American singer Jerry Lee Lewis. The ex-spouse first met in&nbsp;<strong>December 1983,&nbsp;</strong>and since then, they have started having feelings for each other.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/9/8/Flipboard-min-1662615900499.jpg><p>After dating for around four months, the lovely former couple decided to get their tied knot on&nbsp;<strong>April 24, 1984</strong>. They lived in a healthy relationship for twenty-one years, supporting and caring for each other.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, in&nbsp;<strong>June 2005</strong>, McCarver and Lewis made their separate way with the only option of divorce. Since then, McCarver has been living a solo life with her child.&nbsp;</p><h2>Former Spouse Shares One Lovely Child</h2><p>It is not strange that the ex-spouse shares one lovely child as they lived under the same roof for over two decades. Within that period, they got the chance to become parents of one beautiful child named&nbsp;<strong>Jerry Lee Lewis III</strong>.</p><p>Lewis III came into this materialistic world in&nbsp;<strong>1987</strong>. Since his parents' separation, he has been living with his mother, McCarver, as she got custody of him. Moreover, he loves his parents equally and does not have harsh feelings for his father or mother.&nbsp;</p><h2>Is McCarver's A Sixth Wife of Lewis?</h2><p>Undoubtedly, McCarver entered her former husband Lewis's home as a sixth wife. Yes, you heard it right; Lewis was married five times to different women before entering his sixth wife's life.&nbsp;</p><p>Lewis was first married in 1952 to<strong>&nbsp;Dorothy Barton</strong>, whereas his second marriage was held in 1953 to&nbsp;<strong>Jane Mitchum</strong>. Yes, he got separated from his first wife after one year of marriage, whereas he divorced his second wife in 1957.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/9/8/The%20Guardain-1662615922255.jpg><p>Regarding his third wedding,&nbsp;<strong>Myra Gale Brown</strong>&nbsp;is his third wife, who exchanged vows with him in 1958. However, this relationship also could not go further and ended in 1970.&nbsp;</p><p>Soon after Lewis's separation from his third wife, he married&nbsp;<strong>Jaren Elizabeth Gunn Pate</strong>, but unfortunately, she died in 1982, making this married relationship incomplete.&nbsp;</p><p>After one year of Pate's death, he married another woman named&nbsp;<strong>Shawn Stephens&nbsp;</strong>in 1983, but she also left him alone as she died on August 22, 1983, the same year of their marriage.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/9/8/Allvipp-min-1662615935127.jpg><p>After five unsuccessful married life, Lewis became romantically linked with McCarver and made her sixth wife. As mentioned above, they also could not stick together and split in 2005.</p><p>Regarding his current love life, he is enjoying a married relationship with his present wife,&nbsp;<strong>Judith Brown</strong>. They have lived a prosperous life for over a decade as they tied the knot in 2012.</p><h2>How Rich Is McCarver? Know Her Net Worth</h2><p>Well, McCarver's bank balance is still unknown to the public.

He is currently enjoying his bank balance just like<i><strong> </strong></i><a href=# rel=nofollow><i><strong>Boris Becker</strong></i></a>.</p><h2>Body Measurements: Height & Weight&nbsp;</h2><p>It is not strange that McCarver has wrinkles on her face since she has already crossed sixty. She has fair skin, brown eyes, and blonde hair. However, her natural hair color is white.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/9/8/Married%20Biography-1662616053311.jpg><p>Regarding McCarver's height and weight, she has not revealed it.
