In my view, we need to see pain in the economy.

My comments were deeply insensitive to employees, tradies, and families across Australia who are affected by these cost-of-living pressures and job losses.</p><p>“I want to be clear: I do appreciate that when someone loses their job it has a profound impact on them and their families and I sincerely regret that my words did not convey empathy for those in that situation.”</p><p>Gurner previously sparked national headlines in 2017 when he accused younger workers of spending too much money on smashed avocados.</p><p>“When I was trying to buy my first home, I wasn’t buying smashed avocado for $19 and four coffees at $4 each,” he said.</p><p>“This generation is watching the Kardashians and thinking that’s normal — thinking owning a Bentley is normal.”</p><p>Mr Gurner has also previously told Forbes Australia in an exclusive report that he’s “tried everything” in his own life to boost productivity and wellness including IV drips, infra-red saunas, and psychedelic mushrooms.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Gurner apologized after his remarks sparked international condemnation and claimed the millionaire lacked empathy for workers and that his views were “disgusting.” <span class=credit>Financial Review</span></figure><p>“From micro-dosing mushrooms to infra-red saunas to steam to Oura, lymphatic drainage. Everything. I want to try everything and see what works for me,’’ he said.</p><p>The Australian Financial Review reported today that a senior manager at Gurner’s Saint Haven network sent a memo to staff on Wednesday addressing the comments.</p><p>“To our Saint Haven family … I want to start by saying I’ve had the pleasure of working with Tim for almost two years now and can hand on heart say that his care and love for both the Gurner Group and Saint Haven team is immense,’’ the note said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3Jmam1foratuMiopZqhopp6pbHVnqOoqJWneri0zmaqmqGUYq%2BtwcRmmqiknJa%2FbsPOq6KeqqNirrOxjKitnqqglralec2enJ1lpKR6psTPnqminZ6Ysm68wKKlZpmgpLmws8iznKxn</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./pedro-pascal-biography.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Pedro Pascal  Bio (Wiki) ">&larr;
