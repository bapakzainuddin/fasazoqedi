His content usually includes beauty advice and tips on personal care and cosmetics. From the looks of it, Hampton only uses his social media platform for his profession.</p><p class=dh>On the other hand, his personal life is kept away from the public.

The only public information revealed was that the actress first posted about him on July 14, 2021, as a tribute to his birthday.</p><p class=dh>Ricci <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.instagram.com/p/CRT5QsNM_eE/?utm_source=ig_embed&ig_rid=4ec20952-e41e-45ad-82d7-0efdb5a7e18d">described</a> him as "[her] favorite person, gorgeous human, bringer of all things happy, magical and good." Not long after, she announced that they were expecting their first child together.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>When Did Christina Ricci and Mark Hampton Get Married?</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>As their relationship was kept under wraps, it came as no surprise that the couple had a <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.etonline.com/christina-ricci-marries-mark-hampton-two-months-after-pregnancy-announcement-pics-173514>low-key wedding</a> two months after their baby announcement.</p><p class=dh>Ricci announced the wonderful news on Instagram with a photo with her husband, smiling beneath an arch of roses.

Recalling her first time trying to sleep train her son, he screamed at the top of his lungs and banged his head against the crib. However, Cleo only whined for a few minutes before calming down and falling asleep.</p><p class=dh>She also places her son on big brother duties, paying him to watch Clea sleep for 20 minutes. Freddie has been helpful with Cleo and can help in the bathtub and make bottles with his mom. "There hasn't been a lot of sibling jealousy or anything," she <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/parents/christina-ricci-baby-daughter-sleep-trained-son-still-sleeps-with-mom-exclusive/>said</a>.
