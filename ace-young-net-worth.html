Overall, he was ranked seventh in the competition. Young has been active in the entertainment industry since 2000.</p><p>How much is the net worth of Ace Young? It has been reported by authoritative sources that the overall size of his wealth is as much as $8 million, as of the data presented in the middle of 2017. Music is the main source of Young’s fortune.</p><h3>Ace Young Net Worth $8 Million</h3><p>To begin with, the boy was raised in the family of Jay Young and Kay Whitney – he was named after his grandfather <a href=#>George Brett</a> who was a baseball player. Young has sung since the early childhood. He learnt at singing classes and performed at various festivities in shopping centres. He graduated from a secondary school called Fairview High School in 1999.</p><p>Young auditioned for American Idol in Denver, Colorado, himself using the name ‘Ace’. Singing “Swear It Again” by Westlife he made it to the next round, and was one of 24 participants who reached the semi-final; his first song presented to the Top 24 was “Father Figure” by <a href=#>George Michael</a>, and afterwards sang, among others, <a href=#>Michael Jackson’s</a>&nbsp;“Butterflies”, Wonder’s “Do I Do”, Train’s “Drops Of Jupiter” as well as <a href=#>Keith Urban’s</a> “Tonight I Wanna Cry”. Overall, he finished 7th.</p><p>After his participation in American Idol, Ace appeared as a guest in the “Total Request Live” program, singing “Do not Go” a song written by himself. He was named one of the most handsome soloists in People Magazine in 2006. The same year, he released his first single “Scattered”, and helped his friend <a href=#>Chris Daughtry</a> to write the chorus for his new single “It’s Not Over”. He was also part of the Walt Disney Christmas Day Parade show, accompanied by other American Idol comrades including Paris Bennett, Kevin Covais and Mandisa. Young subsequently signed a contract with S Curve Records (Virgin Records) to release his album “Ace Young” (2008). Additionally he has participated at several baseball games, singing the US National Anthem. He also appeared in an episode of “The Bones” TV series, in which he played an amateur singer who is found dead.</p><p>Finally, in the personal life of Young, he has dated the actress Essence Atkins. In addition to his friendship with Chris Daughtry, Ace is also friends with other American Idol participants such as Paris Bennett, Lisa Tucker, Kevin Covais and <a href=#>Kellie Pickler</a>. In 2012, during the final of “American Idol” season 11, Young proposed to his girlfriend <a href=#>Diana DeGarmo</a> (participant of Season 3) in front of millions. She said “Yes”, and they married the following year.</p><p>Since 1999, Ace Young has volunteered at the Children’s Hospital of Denver. He attends it each Christmas helping and entertaining the children. Ace has always told us about his great affection for children and his desire to someday have his own too. Ace Young started his own charity work called Highrollers with Heart in 2006.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlanEsL7Toaeoq6RjsLC5jpqanmWppMKvs4ynnK1lp6S%2FtbSO</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./anderson-paak-wife-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Anderson Paaks Wife Jaylyn Chang Has Been with Him through Thick and Thin">&larr;
