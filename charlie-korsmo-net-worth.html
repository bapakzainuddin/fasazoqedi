As of mid-2017, sources inform us of a net worth that is at $500,000, earned through a career in acting and law. He now works with numerous law schools as well as political organizations. He’s also reportedly working on a film project and as he continues his career, it is expected that his wealth will also continue to increase.</p><h3>Charlie Korsmo Net Worth $500,000</h3><p>Charlie grew up in Minneapolis and attended Breck School, matriculating in 1996. His acting career started eight years prior when he was part of the filming of “Men Don’t Leave”, the comedy drama starring <a href=#>Jessica Lange</a>, a remake of the French film “La Vie Continue”. Two years later, he was cast as The Kid/Dick Tracy, Jr. in “Dick Tracy”, a performance which earned him nominations for a Young Artist Award and Saturn Award. Afterwards, he would become part of the film “Heat Wave” directed by <a href=#>Kevin Hooks</a>; his net worth was growing steadily.</p><p>More projects opened up for Korsmo, and his net worth increased further thanks to them. In 1991, he appeared in “What About Bob?” as the son of Richard Dreyfuss’ character. He was also part of the film “The Doctor” which is based on the book “A Taste of My Own Medicine”. His net worth would increase again when he was cast in “Hook” as the son of Peter Pan, Jack Banning. He was nominated for a Chicago Film Critics Association Award, and a Young Artist Award for Best Young Actor. He won a Young Artist Award for Outstanding Young Ensemble Cast in a Motion Picture.</p><p>Charlie’s last film would be in 1998 entitled “Can’t Hardly Wait”.</p><p>In 2000, Charlie completed a physics degree at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and then went to work for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the House of Representatives as part of the Republican Party. In 2006, he then received a Juris Doctor degree from Yale Law School; during his time in Yale, he was a member of the Federalist Society. He passed the New York State Bar exam the following year, and became an associate at the Sullivan & Cromwell LLP New York office, and also a visiting professor at Brooklyn Law School. After those opportunities, Korsmo moved to Case Western Reserve University School of Law to work as a professor. In 2011, he was nominated by President <a href=#>Barack Obama</a> to become a member of the Board of Trustees of the Barry Goldwater Scholarship and Excellence in Education Foundation.</p><p>Recent reports have also indicated that Charlie has been cast to be a part of the controversial art film entitled “Chained for Life” set to be released in 2018.</p><p>For his personal life, it is known that Korsmo is married to Adrienne and they have two children together.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=5.9817767653759><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Charlie Korsmo</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$500,000</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>July 20, 1978</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Fargo, North Dakota, USA</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5' 8½" (1.74 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Actor</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>Yale Law School</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Adrienne Korsmo</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Children</td><td>William Korsmo, Lilah Korsmo</td></tr><tr><td>Parents</td><td>John Korsmo, Deborah Ruf</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>Joe Korsmo, Ted Korsmo</td></tr><tr readability=0.20512820512821><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001432/</a></td></tr><tr readability=8><td>Movies</td><td>Can't Hardly Wait, Hook, The Doctor, What About Bob?, Heat Wave, Dick Tracy, Men Don't Leave</td></tr></table><table class=trademarks readability=1.5><tr><th>#</th><th>Trademark</th></tr><tr readability=3><td>1</td><td>Often plays intelligent, thoughtful characters</td></tr></table><table class=quotes readability=20.820937340805><tr><th>#</th><th>Quote</th></tr><tr readability=5><td>1</td><td>From Case Western Law Docket: [T]hat's where my practice experience is - corporate and banking law.
