Dave Mustaine became famous back in the ‘80s, being the original lead guitarist for Metallica. After he left the band, he joined Megadeth, a thrash metal band, for which he is a guitarist and the lead singer.</p><p>So just how rich is Dave Mustaine? His net worth is estimated by sources at $20 million. In 2009, he was ranked number one in the best metal guitarists list, therefore his earnings in the music industry make the main source for the singer’s net worth.</p><h3>Dave Mustaine Net Worth $20 Million</h3><p>Dave Mustaine started performing for Panic, but he became famous as the lead guitarist for Metallica, although he was part of the band for less than two years, so he never actually contributed to any of the band’s albums. After he was fired in 1983 because of his alcohol and drugs problems, Mustaine founded Fallen Angels, but this band lasted less than a year. In 1984, the guitarist became the lead singer for Megadeth, the band for which he is still performing today. The band has launched more than 20 albums, live albums and compilations, including “Countdown to Extinction” (1992), “Risk” (1999), “Rust in Peace” (1990), and “Icon” (2014) and received several Platinum and Gold certifications, not only in the USA, but also in Australia, the UK, Finland and Germany. Dave Mustaine has also made appearances in several television shows and documentaries, such as “Black Scorpion”, “The <a href=#>Drew Carey</a> Show”, “Hell’s Kitchen”, “Duck Dodgers”, and “The Hour”.</p><p>Dave Mustaine makes money from touring, album sales and royalties. His band is the founder of a travelling heavy metal music festival, called Gigantour, registered and released also on DVD, for which Mustaine was an executive producer in 2009. The guitarist has his own line of guitars, made at the beginning with the Jackson Company and later with ESP Guitars. He is also the author and performer of several soundtracks, especially for television shows and series.</p><p>Besides music, Dave Mustaine completes his income from selling wine. The rock star owns a house and a vineyard near Fallbrook, in San Diego County, where he produces Cabernet Sauvignon. The first wine made at Mustaine Vineyards was launched in 2012 under the name “Symphony Interrupted”. Dave Mustaine is also co-owner of Cooperstown, a bar/restaurant in Phoenix, Arizona.</p><p>Besides music, Mustaine is fan of the martial arts, with black belts in Ukidokan Karate and Taekwondo. He also is driving race cars and participated to the Watkins Glen International raceway in New York, in 2015. In 2010 he published also a book, called “Mustaine: a heavy metal memoir”, which adds more money to the rock star`s net worth.</p><p>In 1992, Dave Mustaine was a reporter for MTV at the Democratic National Convention, but then in 2012, he supported the Republican candidate Rick Santorum. Over the years he has made numerous statements about the USA`s internal and foreign politics, many of them controversial.</p><p>In 1991, Dave Mustaine married Pamela Anne Casselberry; the couple has a son and a daughter.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=22.322874493927><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Dave Mustaine</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$20 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>September 13, 1961</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>La Mesa, California, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>6 ft (1.83 m)</td></tr><tr readability=11><td>Profession</td><td>Singer, Musician, Songwriter, Actor, Record producer, Singer-songwriter, Author, Guitarist, Talent manager</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>United States of America</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Spouse</td><td>Pamela Anne Casselberry (m. 1991)</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Children</td><td>Electra Nicole Mustaine, Justis David Mustaine</td></tr><tr readability=7><td>Parents</td><td>Emily Mustaine, John Mustaine, Symphony of Destruction, Holy Wars… The Punishment Due, À Tout le Monde</td></tr><tr readability=9><td>Nicknames</td><td>David Scott Mustaine , Megadave , dave_mustaine , Dangerous Dave , Mustaine , David Mustaine , Mustaine Dave</td></tr><tr readability=0.36363636363636><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.facebook.com/davemustaine</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.33333333333333><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.twitter.com/davemustaine</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.27450980392157><td>Google+</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://plus.google.com/112832745267678653771</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.39130434782609><td>Instagram</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.instagram.com/davemustaine</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.21052631578947><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0615962</a></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Awards</td><td>Kerrang!

But one day, I put in the CD and was just like, "Wow! This guy wants to play with us? Let's bring him in.
