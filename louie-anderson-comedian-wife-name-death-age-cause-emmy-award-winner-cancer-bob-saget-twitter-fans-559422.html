He was 68. The sad news of his demise was confirmed by his publicist, who a few days ago had revealed that the actor was in the hospital, as reported by Variety. The veteran comedian was best known for his FX comedy television series ‘Baskets’ for which we won the coveted Emmy Award in 2016.<br>&nbsp;<br>The unfortunate news of death comes days after Hollywood’s legendary comedian breathed his last. On January 9, Saget was found dead at an Orlando hotel, reportedly suffering from a . He was laid to rest on January 14, in a star-studded affair with his funeral attended by the 'Full House' cast, as well as fellow comedians and friends like John Mayer, John Stamos, Jimmy Kimmel, Jeff Ross, Marc Maron, and Dave Chappelle.<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>READ MORE</strong><br></p><h2 class=split>Who was Louie Anderson's wife?</h2><p>Louie Anderson was born and raised in Saint Paul, Minnesota, and was the second youngest of 11 children in his family. His father was a trumpeter for singer Hoagy Carmichael. Speaking of his wife, the prolific author tied the knot with his high school sweetheart. Anderson got married to the love of his life in the year 1985. However, the identity of his wife is not known. Things soon went sour between the couple as the marriage lasted only for four weeks- probably one of the short-lived marriages in history. The late comedian also did not have any children of his own.<br>&nbsp;<br>Anderson, who was nominated for Emmy Award thrice, also penned four books including the popular ‘Hey Mom: Stories for My Mother’, and ‘But You Can Read Them Too’, which was published in 2018. &nbsp;The actor recently reprised his role in the sequel to Coming to America” and also appeared in a guest role in Season 3 of the HBO Max original series ‘Search Party’. &nbsp;He also performed a stand-up show called ‘Louie: Larger Than Life’ in Las Vegas, Nevada, from 2003 through 2012. The comedian also made headlines in 1997 when he got blackmailed by an individual named Richard John Gordon. The latter had demanded money by threatening that he would reveal to tabloids that Anderson reportedly sexually propositioned him in a casino in 1993. Gordon was later arrested and was fined and sentenced to 21 months in prison.</p><h2 class=split>‘So funny. So gentle. You were always encouraging’</h2><p>Social media users were left stunned after the death of the comedian legend. “I always loved how effortless @LouieAnderson made stand up look. He could get an applause break with a slight change of expression or a sideway glance. A true master. Thank you for all the laughs and for being so nice. You were one of the greats! Rest In Peace”, said one as another chimed in, “Baskets was such a phenomenal “second act” for Louie Anderson. I wish he’d gotten a third. RIP.” The next one added, “Louie Anderson was a very dear friend and one of the people who very early in my career believed in me and would put me and a couple of other comics he loved up in a hotel in Vegas and pay us to open for him when we needed money. What a huge loss. Rest in peace my friend.”<br>&nbsp;<br>Meanwhile, another tweeted, “Louie Anderson putting the mic stand behind him and saying “let me move this out of the way so you can see me” is one of the best openers of all time.” One user stated, “Louie Anderson : Your generosity of spirit will cover the world from above .. we are so lucky you were on earth for a moment , spreading your humor all over like bars of living gold .. Good Bye” as, another concluded, “I feel so lucky that I knew you Louie Anderson. So funny. So gentle. You were always encouraging. A midwestern big brother from another big midwestern family in this crazy business. You conquered stand up, writing (Dear Dad) & most recently we fell in love w/ ur acting in Baskets.”</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>I always loved how effortless made stand up look.
