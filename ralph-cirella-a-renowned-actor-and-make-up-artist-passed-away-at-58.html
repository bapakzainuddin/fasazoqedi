He was, without a doubt, a one-of-a-kind soul. Ralph wasn’t just a friend; he was family. My mother adored him, and I’ll always cherish the memory of her affectionately mistaking his “berry” for a piece of red jello on his upper lip, playfully attempting to wipe it away. When met in the old days where he worked his magic as a makeup artist for Howard Stern’s Channel 9 show. I can vividly recall how he transformed Howard into a perfect replica of Larry King, showcasing his exceptional talent and creativity. From the day forward, we were life long friends, I just wished he lived longer. Ralph possessed an abundance of untapped potential, but he grappled with finding the motivation to fully realize it—a painful reality that we all witnessed. It serves as a poignant reminder of life’s unpredictability and the importance of not only pursuing our dreams but also seeing them through to the end.My heart aches at the thought of Ralph departing this world alone, without ever experiencing the deep love he undeniably deserved. In our final exchange, I shared a story about someone who called me lucky. When I asked why, their response was simple and profound: “Because you’re friends with Ralph from the Howard Stern show.” And they were absolutely right.My dear friend, I will miss you so much. I love you, Ralphie boy. Rest in peace.HEY NOW XO</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_was_the_Cause_of_Ralph_Cirella_Death></span><span></span><strong>What was the Cause of Ralph Cirella Death?</strong><span></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>At this time, the exact cause of Ralph Cirella’s death remains undisclosed.
