However, she replied that:</p><p>No, I didn’t know. I was always kind of curious about it. But you can say that about so many generations and so many different industries. And yet, I grew up sort of distanced from it, so I had more of curiosity around it that sort of curated this interest in what it was to be a part of making movies and TV.</p><p>Additionally, Brolin clarified that she always wanted to follow in her father's footsteps from an early age.</p><p><i><strong>For more interesting biographies, do visit </strong></i><a href=#><i><strong>MarriedCeleb.</strong></i></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jp6bnqZdl7%2BwuMin</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./214720-bette-davis-inside-life-death-beloved-al-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Bette Davis  Inside Life and Death of the Beloved 'All About Eve' Star">&larr;
