style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p>Police have released frightening bodycam footage of the moment officers took out <a href=#>mass shooter Audrey Hale</a> — as it was revealed she suffered from an “emotional disorder” and hid her cache of weapons from her parents.</p><p>The footage, released by the Metropolitan Nashville Police Department, shows officers Rex Englebert and Michael Collazo storming through The Covenant School’s hallways as they methodically hunted down the&nbsp;28-year-old&nbsp;mass killer on Monday.</p><p>Soon after entering the building, the heroic cops could be seen rushing towards an atrium on the second floor of the private Christian academy while repeatedly shouting “shots fired.”</p><p>As they rounded the corner and laid eyes on Hale, the bodycam shows officers rapidly firing as the shooter blasted bullets in their direction. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Seconds later, Hale could be seen dropping to the floor.</p><p>The footage shows cops cautiously approaching the shooter’s limp body as they screamed “don’t move” and “get your hands away from the gun.”</p><p>Hale, who was armed with two rifles and a handgun, was killed in the shootout.</p><p>At a press conference on Tuesday, Metropolitan Nashville Police Chief John Drake said the 28-year-old <a href=#>had legally purchased seven guns from various local stores</a> &nbsp;— including the three used in the massacre.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">The footage shows the moment cops took out Audrey Hale after she opened fire at the Covenant School in Nashville on Monday. <span class=credit>Metropolitan Nashville Police Department</span></figure><p>The shooter was also being treated for an emotional disorder — and had hidden her cache of weapons from her parents, the police chief said.</p><p>“She was under care, doctor’s care, for an emotional disorder,” Drake told reporters, adding that cops “knew nothing about the treatment she was receiving.”</p><p>The police chief did not elaborate on what kind of emotional disorder she was suffering.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image

to the Hale family <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">told the Daily Beast</a> that the shooter was autistic “but high-functioning” — however, cops were unable to immediately confirm that.</p><p>Hale also&nbsp;<a href=#>identified as transgender</a>, Drake revealed at an earlier press conference Monday, though it wasn’t clear whether the suspect identified as a man or woman.</p><p>Asked whether Hale’s identity could be a factor in the motive, Drake said, “There is some theory to that, we’re investigating all the leads.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Hale is seen on the ground after the shootout. <span class=credit>Metropolitan Nashville Police Department</span></figure><p>Hale used male pronouns and the name Aiden on some social media accounts.</p><p>The mass killer – dressed&nbsp;in a red hat backward, military fatigue pants, and a dark vest&nbsp;—&nbsp;had also earlier been captured on&nbsp;<a href=#>surveillance video casually stalking</a>&nbsp;the hallways for victims&nbsp;as cops were rushing towards the scene.</p><p>Police said Hale managed to gain access to the school by pumping bullets through the glass doors on the side of the building.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Footage released by the Metropolitan Nashville Police Department, shows officer Rex Englebert storming through the school’s hallways looking for Hale. <span class=credit>MNPD/MEGA</span></figure><p>After unleashing a reign of deadly terror, the shooter then started firing at arriving officers from the second-story window where she was eventually taken out.</p><p>Hale gunned down three 9-year-olds and three staffers in the minutes before police fatally shot her.</p><p>The victims have been identified as Evelyn Dieckhaus, Hallie Scruggs, and Williams Kinney, as well as custodian Mike Hill, 61, substitute teacher Cynthia Peak, 61, and headmaster Katherine Koonce, 60.</p><figure
